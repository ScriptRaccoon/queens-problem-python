# Generator for solutions to the n queens problem

This Python program generates solutions to the [n queens problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle) with a generator function. See the docstrings in `queens.py` for more information how it is done. For comparision, there is also `queens_slow.py` which uses lists and takes much longer to compute when `n` is large, in particular when one is only interested in a couple of solutions instead of all of them.
